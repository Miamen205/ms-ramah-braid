                <p id="privacyP" className="privacyP">R4C is opportune to host a 3- day KR4C (Kids Revolution for Christ) Summer Camp, annually. During the duration of the camp, lectures are presented on essential tools needed to become a more valuable member of society. Attendees are able to learn more about the Bible with their peers and how to live a good life abstaining from sin, distraction, and the life of crime. Kids are lectured on the importance of obeying their parents and the blessing that comes with it as well as the curse and disasters that comes with disobedience. They also learn to respect not only their elders but their peers as well, who might have a different opinion or belief system from theirs. They learn how to treat everyone with the respect they deserve because respect is reciprocal. Many other major subject-matters are discussed during this 3-days Camp. Attendees are presented with various creative and fun activities and games that keep them involved and active throughout the duration of the camp. At the end of camp, a back-to-school package is put together for each child which includes; backpacks, pencils, pen, erasers, books, deodorants, toothbrush, toothpaste, and other hygiene products and school related items. </p>
